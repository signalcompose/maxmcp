# Research Documentation

This directory contains research findings and investigation results collected during MaxMCP development.

---

## Purpose

Store documentation for:
- Web searches using `/gemini-search` or `WebFetch`
- Technical investigations
- Design decision research
- Third-party library evaluations
- Performance benchmarks

---

## Future Plans

**This directory will be converted to a sub-repository in the future.**

Rationale:
- Keep research separate from implementation
- Allow independent versioning
- Enable reuse across projects
- Maintain clean main repository

---

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive English names that reflect the research topic:

**Good**:
- `max-sdk-threading-model.md`
- `json-rpc-error-codes.md`
- `stdio-buffering-performance.md`

**Bad**:
- `research1.md`
- `notes.md`
- `tmp.md`
